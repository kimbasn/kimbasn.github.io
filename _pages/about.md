# About Me

My name is **Kimba SABI N'GOYE**, and I am a passionate **Software Development Engineer** with a strong focus on building scalable systems that power data-driven applications.

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/imsp-valley.jpg" | absolute_url }}" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

My journey into the world of technology began in the **north of Benin Republic**, where I developed a passion for **mathematics** and **physics**, ultimately earning my **Baccalaureat** in these fields. I then completed my undergraduate studies in **Computer Science** at the **Institut de Mathématiques et de Sciences Physiques**, one of African Center of Excellence in STEM [2] located in **Dangbo**, a city in the **Oueme Lower Valley** (a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve). Following this, I pursued a **Master's in Data Science**. During my time in the program, I was honored to serve as the **Vice-President of the Student Council**, a role that significantly strengthened my leadership and collaboration skills. Additionally, I **volunteered** as a **technical support** resource for both students and educational staff, applying my technical expertise to enhance their learning experience.

My professional career began with an internship at **Huawei** in **Cotonou**, where I worked as a **Software Engineer** focused on telecom software delivery. This experience ignited my passion for tackling complex challenges in high-impact, real-world environments. Following my internship, Huawei offered me a full-time position, where I contributed to the delivery and maintenance of four telecom software projects, overseeing the entire process from the hardware to the software layer.

Seeking new challenges, I moved to **France** to pursue a second **Master’s degree** at **Université Paris-Saclay**, specializing in **Data Management in Large-Scale Distributed Systems**. During this time, I completed an internship at **Renault** as a **Cloud and Data Engineer**, where I developed code generation tools for data engineers, reducing development time by an estimated **30%**. Additionally, I implemented an automatic acceptance test executor, enabling the business team to verify the compliance of tables produced by the data pipeline with their requirements.

### Awards & Achievements
- **1st Place** in Applied Computer Science Category at the **University Olympiads of CAMES**, issued by the African and Malagasy Council for Higher Education (CAMES), November 2022. Achieved this out of **483 students** from **24** higher education and research institutions across Africa.
- Participated to the **North Africa Regional Phase of ICPC** (International Collegiate Programming Contest), December 2021.
- **2nd Place** at a hackathon organized by the **Digital Science and Technology Network** – DSTN, Saint Louis(Senegal), December 2021.

Outside of work, I’m an avid football player and runner. I also enjoy reading self-help books and continually strive to expand my knowledge, always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies.
