## Project Overview

A production-grade, append-only commit log implementation built from scratch in Go, mirroring the architecture of systems like Apache Kafka, NATS Streaming, and database WAL implementations. This project demonstrates advanced systems programming concepts, distributed systems design patterns, and comprehensive test-driven development practices.

The system serves as both a learning exercise in distributed systems and a production-ready infrastructure component for event-driven architectures, showcasing the ability to build complex, high-performance infrastructure components while maintaining code quality and clear architectural boundaries.

## Key Features

- **High-Performance Storage**
  - Memory-mapped indexes for O(1) offset lookups
  - Buffered I/O with configurable sync policies
  - Length-prefixed binary framing for efficient parsing
  - Automatic segment rotation based on size thresholds

- **Robust Concurrency**
  - Thread-safe operations using sync.RWMutex
  - Lock-free read paths where possible
  - Graceful handling of concurrent append/read operations

- **Protocol Buffer Integration**
  - Structured data serialization with backward compatibility
  - Generated gRPC service definitions
  - Efficient binary encoding for network and disk operations

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
  - Test-driven development (TDD) methodology throughout
  - Unit tests for all layers with 100% coverage goals
  - Performance benchmarks for critical paths

## Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

- **Record**: Protocol Buffer-encoded data structure for persistent storage
- **Store**: File-backed storage layer with length-prefixed binary framing
- **Index**: Memory-mapped index providing O(1) offset-to-position lookups
- **Segment**: Coordinated store+index pairs with automatic rotation boundaries
- **Log**: Multi-segment orchestration layer handling reads across segment boundaries
- **Server**: gRPC API layer with streaming support for high-throughput operations

### Design Principles

- **Append-Only Architecture**: Immutable log structure enabling fast writes and consistent reads
- **Segmented Storage**: Horizontal partitioning for efficient compaction and retention policies
- **Index Optimization**: Fixed-width entries for predictable performance characteristics
- **Network Protocol Design**: gRPC streaming for high-throughput producer/consumer patterns

### Performance Characteristics

- **High Write Throughput**: Append-only design with batched disk syncs
- **Fast Random Reads**: O(1) offset lookups via memory-mapped indexes
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Streaming APIs prevent memory bloat during large operations
- **Predictable Latency**: Fixed-width data structures and pre-allocated buffers

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.24+
- **Serialization**: Protocol Buffers
- **API Layer**: gRPC with streaming support
- **Storage**: File-based with memory mapping via gommap
- **Testing**: Go testing package with testify assertions
- **Concurrency**: sync.RWMutex, atomic operations
- **Binary Encoding**: encoding/binary for cross-platform compatibility

### Advanced Go Features

- **File I/O Optimization**: Uses `os.File`, `bufio.Writer`, memory mapping
- **Concurrency Patterns**: Reader-writer locks, atomic operations, safe shutdown procedures
- **Error Handling**: Idiomatic Go error patterns with custom error types
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependency injection and interface-based design

## Future Enhancements

The foundation supports advanced distributed systems features:

- **Security & Authentication**
  - TLS-encrypted transport with certificate-based authentication
  - Role-based access control and authorization

- **Distributed Systems**
  - Leader-follower replication with consensus protocols
  - Multi-node clustering with automatic failover
  - Partition tolerance and network split handling

- **Advanced Features**
  - Stream processing with exactly-once semantics
  - Log compaction and retention policies
  - Metrics, tracing, and operational tooling integration

- **Observability**
  - Performance monitoring and alerting
  - Distributed tracing integration
  - Health checks and status endpoints
