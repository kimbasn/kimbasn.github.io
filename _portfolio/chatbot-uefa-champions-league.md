## Project Overview
The UEFA Champions League is one of the world’s most prestigious football tournaments, drawing the attention of millions of fans globally. To facilitate access to accurate, and engaging information, I developed an Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. This chatbot provides users with seamless access to both structured and unstructured data about players, teams, and matches.

By leveraging knowledge graphs, the chatbot delivers personalized, data-driven responses, enhancing user engagement and offering a rich, interactive experience for football enthusiasts. The primary goal is to simplify access to comprehensive statistics and insights, ensuring fans stay informed and entertained.


## **Key Features**

- **Comprehensive Football Stats:** Easily access detailed information about players, teams, and match results from the UEFA Champions League based on historical data.
- **Personalized Responses:** Get customized answers to specific questions like "Who scored the most goals?" or "Which team has the youngest players?" using structured statistics from the knowledge graph.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interact through a simple web interface—just type your question and receive immediate, data-driven responses.
- **Detailed Match and Player Insights:** Explore in-depth stats, such as player performances, team achievements, and match outcomes, all sourced from reliable historical data.
- **Broad Query Range:** Discover insights across a variety of topics, including player stats, team comparisons, and match history, to enhance your knowledge of the UEFA Champions League.


## Architecture
The UEFA Champions League Chatbot operates by combining a knowledge graph stored in Neo4j with a language model from OpenAI to deliver structured, data-driven responses. When a user submits a query via the Streamlit interface, the system uses a custom pipeline to process the input. First, the natural language query is translated into a Cypher query using a few-shot prompting technique, which enables the chatbot to dynamically generate appropriate queries for the Neo4j graph database. This graph stores detailed relationships between players, teams, and match statistics. The Cypher query is executed to retrieve relevant data, which is then passed to OpenAI's GPT model to generate a comprehensive and human-readable response. The FastAPI backend orchestrates these operations, managing communication between the user interface, the chatbot, and the Neo4j database, ensuring efficient query execution and real-time interaction. This architecture allows the system to provide rich, context-aware responses while handling structured data in an efficient manner.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** The core language for application development.
- **Neo4j:** A graph database for modeling and storing structured football data like players, teams, and matches.
- **Cypher:** A query language for Neo4j, used to retrieve complex relationships from the database.
- **OpenAI GPT:** A language model that generates natural language responses based on the retrieved data.
- **Langchain:** A framework for integrating natural language understanding and generation capabilities into the chatbot.
- **FastAPI:** A fast and scalable API framework to handle backend operations and manage communication between the chatbot and Neo4j.
- **Streamlit:** A Python-based framework for building the interactive user interface.

## Future Enhancements

- **Automated Data Updates:** Implement a data pipeline to automatically update player, team, and match statistics, ensuring users receive the most up-to-date information.
- **Incorporate Unstructured Data:** Integrate unstructured data sources, such as social media reactions or match reports, to provide richer insights and context in responses.
- **Real-Time Match Insights:** Enable real-time querying and responses during live matches to enhance user engagement with current events.
- **Personalized User Experience:** Implement user profiles to track favorite teams or players, offering personalized recommendations and updates.
- **More competition Support:** Extend chatbot capabilities to support multiple competition, broadening accessibility for global football fans.
